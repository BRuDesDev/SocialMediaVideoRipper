# Social Media Video Ripper

Simple but elegant CLI script that prompts the user for a url to a video on a social media platform (tested to work for Facebook and Twitter(X) - tho I'm sure it would work for others as well). 


### To use this yourself: 


~ $ git clone https://github.com/BRuDesDev/SocialMediaVideoRipper.git 

~ $ cd SocialMediaVideoRipper 

~ $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Then all you have to do:
~ $ python3 SocialMediaVideoRipper.py 

The user can then input a 'url' and (save)'name' - press Enter - and you can see the download in the terminal as well as a finished message.

You will find the downloaded video in a folder called **videos** in the apps root dir, unless you changed that within the script.
